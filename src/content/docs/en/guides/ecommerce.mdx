Astro supports several e-commerce options, from checkout links to hosted payment pages to building an entire storefront using a payment service API.


## Payment processing platforms

Some payment processing services add a payment form to allow your customer to purchase from your site. These can be hosted overlays or embedded in a page on your site. These may offer some basic customization or site branding, and may be added as scripts, buttons, or external links.

### Lemon Squeezy

Lemon Squeezy is an all-in-one platform for payments and subscriptions with multi-currency support, global tax compliance, PayPal integration and more. It allows you to create and manage digital products and services through your account dashboard and provides product URLs for the checkout process.

The basic [Lemon.js JavaScript library](https://docs.lemonsqueezy.com/help/lemonjs/what-is-lemonjs) allows you to sell your Lemon Squeezy products with a checkout link.

#### Basic Usage

1. Add the following `<script>` tag to your page `head` or `body`:

    ```html
    <script src="https://app.lemonsqueezy.com/js/lemon.js" defer></script>
    ```
2. Create an anchor tag on the page linking to your product URL. Include the class `lemonsqueezy-button` to open a checkout overlay when clicked.

    ```astro
    <a class="lemonsqueezy-button" href="https://demo.lemonsqueezy.com/checkout/...">
        Buy My Amazing Product
    </a>
    ```
#### Advanced Usage

Lemon.js also provides additional behavior such as [programmatically opening overlays](https://docs.lemonsqueezy.com/help/lemonjs/opening-overlays) and [handling overlay events](https://docs.lemonsqueezy.com/help/lemonjs/opening-overlays).

Read the [Lemon Squeezy API documentation](https://docs.lemonsqueezy.com/api) or the [Lemon Squeezy developer getting started guide](https://docs.lemonsqueezy.com/guides/developer-guide) for more information.
